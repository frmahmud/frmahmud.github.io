            <p>Canberra Evolutionary Optimization Research, SEIT, UNSW, Canberra, Australia</p>
            <p><b>Supervisor:</b><a href="https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-ruhul-sarker">Professor Ruhul Sarker</a></p>
            <p><b>Project:</b>Robust Evolutionary Algorithms for Changing and Uncertain Environments.</p>
            <p><b>Project Goal:</b>The aim of this project is to develop an efficient algorithm to handle heterogeneous activities and create a new dataset for heterogeneous project scheduling problem (HPSP). </p>
            <p><b>Contribution:</b>I lead the project with three more contributors. As an initial contribution, I already created a new benchmark set for HPSP, as well as proposed a new variant of scheduling problem. After implementing, the experimental result of the proposed approach showed that it obtains similar quality solution with a significantly less computational time in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithm. In future, I will consider dynamic environments such as stochastic activity durations, resource disruptions, time-varying resource demands as well as availability.</p>

            <p>Image Processing & Remote Sensing, Dept. of CSE, RUET, Rajshahi, Bangladesh</p>
            <p><b>Supervisor:</b><a href="http://www.ruet.ac.bd/teacher/CSE/almamun">Prof. Md. Al Mamun</a></p>
            <p><b>Project:</b>Machine learning algorithms for facial expression recognition.  </p>
            <p><b>Project Goal:</b>The objective of this project is to design and implement a facial recognition system under non-cooperative and deceptive environments.</p>
            <p><b>Contribution:</b>I worked as a team leader and developed a facial expression recognition system while considering dataset for learning and testing are not user friendly. Our proposed approach can identify appropriate facial expression form the input image, which can be used as a biometric password system to log in, protect the system from unauthorized access and cyber-attacks.</p>

            <p><b>Contributions:</b>As a university teacher, every year, I got 4 to 6 students as their undergrad thesis supervisor (one-year period). My responsibility was to guide them for choosing an appropriate research topic, providing initial knowledge on that selected topic, implementing using the existing approaches as well as proposed approach and analyses the results, preparing paper draft according to the scientific standard. Therefore, we published more than 25 research articles.</p>
