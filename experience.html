            <p class="text-justify"><b>Project Goal:</b> The aim of this project is to develop an efficient algorithm to handle singular resource problems and create a new dataset for singular project scheduling problem. </p>
            <p class="text-justify" style="color:black"><b>Contribution:</b> I have worked as a graduate researcher in the department of Computer Science at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA), Canberra, Australia (June, 2019 to May, 2023). I am a multidisciplinary researcher with the main focus on designing Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) for solving large-scale optimisation problems. My PhD thesis title is “Evolutionary Algorithms for Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSPs)”. The goal of my research was to minimize the total project completion time, manufacturing cost or both while considering practical industrial scenarios. In classical RCPSPs, each activity requires all the available resources, whereas many industrial projects exist where activities may require exactly one resource. Taking motivation from real-world manufacturing systems, I proposed an extension of classical RCPSPs called 'Singular Resource Problems (SRP)'. A heuristic embedded Genetic Algorithm (GA) is proposed for solving this new variant of RCPSPs. To test the proposed algorithm, the RCPSPs problem instances (i.e., 30 to 120 activities problems) from the Project Scheduling Problem Library (PSPLIB) were modified to align with this new variant. Later, the SRP was applied to the multi-objective RCPSPs while considering a day-based cost calculation strategy and time-varying problems. An efficient EA-based framework is proposed for solving these variants of RCPSPs, and the performance is evaluated using small to large-scale problem instances. During my PhD studies, I have published one paper in a Q1 journal, presented three papers at top-ranked conferences, and have two manuscripts that are currently in progress.</p>

            <p class="text-justify"><b>Contribution:</b> As the team leader, I developed a facial expression recognition system that could identify appropriate expressions from input images. Our approach was designed to address the challenges posed by a non-user-friendly dataset used for learning and testing.
