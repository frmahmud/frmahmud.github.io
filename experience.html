            <p><b>Project:</b> Robust Evolutionary Algorithms for Changing and Uncertain Environments.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><b>Project Goal:</b> The aim of this project is to develop an efficient algorithm to handle heterogeneous activities and create a new dataset for heterogeneous project scheduling problem (HPSP). </p>
            <p class="text-justify" style="color:red"><b>Contribution:</b> I lead the project with three more contributors. As an initial contribution, I already created a new benchmark set for HPSP, as well as proposed a new variant of scheduling problem. After implementing, the experimental result of the proposed approach showed that it obtains similar quality solution with a significantly less computational time in comparison with the state-of-the-art algorithm. In future, I will consider dynamic environments such as stochastic activity durations, resource disruptions, time-varying resource demands as well as availability.</p>

            <p class="text-justify"><b>Project Goal:</b> The objective of this project was to design and implement a facial recognition system under non-cooperative and deceptive environments.</p>
            <p class="text-justify"><b>Contribution:</b> As the team leader, I developed a facial expression recognition system that could identify appropriate expressions from input images. Our approach was designed to address the challenges posed by a non-user-friendly dataset used for learning and testing. This system can be used as a biometric password system to log in and protect against unauthorized access and cyber-attacks.</p>

            <p class="text-justify"><b>Contributions:</b> As a university teacher, I supervised 4 to 6 undergraduate students every year for their thesis projects, each spanning a one-year period. I guided them in choosing an appropriate research topic, provided initial knowledge on the selected topic, and assisted in implementing existing and proposed approaches while analyzing the results. Additionally, I helped them in preparing a paper draft that met scientific standards. Thanks to these efforts, our team has successfully published more than 25 research articles.</p>
